/**
 * 32. You are working on an aquarium-simulation class named Aquarius. You already have a method that adds a Fish
 * object to the aquarium and returns the remaining fish capacity. This method has the following declaration:
 * <p>
 * public int addFish( Fish f )
 * <p>
 * Now you want to provide for adding a whole school of fish at once. The proposed method declaration is as follows:
 * <p>
 * protected boolean addFish( Fish[] f )
 * <p>
 * The idea is that it will return true if there is more room in the tank or false if the tank is too full.
 * <p>
 * Which of the following statements about this proposal are true?
 * <p>
 * A. This technique is called overloading. +
 * B. This technique is called overriding.
 * C. The compiler will reject the new method because the return type is different.
 * D. The compiler will reject the new method because the access modifier is different.
